# Advanced Roulette Strategy Analyzer

## Description

This project implements an advanced statistical analysis system for American roulette, using multiple prediction methodologies, mathematical modeling, and simulation. The system integrates classic gaming techniques with modern algorithms to identify patterns and maximize the probability of success.

## Concept and Philosophy

Roulette has traditionally been considered a game of pure chance, but this system explores the premise that through advanced statistical analysis, large-scale simulations, and machine learning methods, it is possible to identify suboptimal patterns in the distribution of results. The project does not claim to "beat" roulette (mathematically impossible under perfect conditions), but rather to optimize decision-making to maximize results in real environments where physical imperfections exist.

## Main Features

- **Multi-strategy Analysis**: Implements more than 20 different strategies, from classic (Martingale) to advanced (neural correlation analysis).
- **Large-Scale Simulation**: Ability to run millions of simulations with adjustable configuration.
- **Bankroll Analysis**: Capital survival simulation with different strategies.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Comparison graphs, heat maps, and performance analysis.
- **Adaptive Optimization**: The system learns from previous results and adjusts parameters.
- **Rigorous Validation**: All strategies undergo cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

## Implemented Strategies

### Classic Historical Strategies
- **Martingale**: Classic doubling system after losses.
- **D'Alembert**: More conservative arithmetic progression than Martingale.
- **Fibonacci**: Sequence based on the Fibonacci series.

### Latin American Strategies
- **Cancellation System**: Crossing-out method for bet management.
- **Mexican Progression**: Adaptive progression system based on clusters.

### Las Vegas Professional Techniques
- **Dealer Signature**: Analysis of dealer-specific patterns.
- **Sector Targeting**: Concentration on physical sectors of the roulette wheel.
- **Visual Ballistics**: Prediction based on physical parameters.
- **Mechanical Bias**: Detection of physical imperfections in the wheel.
- **Chaotic Domain**: Analysis of chaotic domains to predict attractors.

### Advanced Methodologies
- **Neural Correlation**: Correlation analysis using neural networks.
- **Physical Section Analysis**: Study of physical sections of the wheel.
- **Dynamic Clustering**: Dynamic grouping of numbers by behavior.
- **Momentum-Based Analysis**: Analysis based on trends and momentum.
- **Hot Neighbors**: Analysis of adjacent numbers on the physical wheel.
- **Temporal Cycles**: Detection of temporal cycles in the sequence.
- **Variance Balance**: Optimization based on variance balance.
- **Geometric Symmetry**: Analysis of geometric symmetry patterns.

## Analysis and Results

The system generates detailed comparative analyses between all strategies, showing:

- Success rate (win rate) for each strategy
- Relative performance compared to random expectation
- Bankroll evolution with each strategy
- Expected bankroll survival time
- Visualization of recommended numbers through heat maps
- Historical performance tracking between sessions

Tests have shown that certain strategies can achieve success rates above 22.5% for selections of 8 numbers, which represents a significant improvement over the 21.05% randomly expected.

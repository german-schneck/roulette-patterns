# Advanced Roulette Analysis System

A comprehensive statistical analysis system for American roulette, integrating multiple analytical approaches from various cultural and mathematical traditions.

## Features

- **Advanced Statistical Analysis**: Computes complex frequency distributions, streaks, and probability calculations for historical roulette outcomes.
- **Multi-Strategy Analysis**: Implements and tests various betting strategies from different traditions worldwide.
- **Performance Validation**: Rigorous backtesting and forward-testing of strategy performance.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generates detailed graphs and charts to visualize patterns and strategy performance.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies statistical anomalies and potential biases in roulette outcomes.

## Strategies Implemented

### European Strategies
- **Martingale**: Classic doubling strategy after losses
- **Fibonacci**: Betting based on the Fibonacci sequence
- **D'Alembert**: Gradual progression system that increases bets after losses and decreases after wins
- **Labouchere**: Line betting system with a predetermined sequence
- **Oscar's Grind**: Conservative progression system designed for small, steady profits

### Asian Strategies
- **Feng Shui**: Analyzes optimal number selection based on balance and harmony principles
- **I Ching**: Uses the hexagram system to determine betting patterns
- **Pachinko**: Based on clustering patterns inspired by the popular Japanese game

### Latin American Strategies
- **Winograd Strategy**: Focuses on numbers 22-36 with specific low numbers based on Winograd's method

### Advanced Scientific Strategies
- **Quantum Edge**: Utilizes quantum mechanics principles to detect patterns in roulette results, analyzing Von Neumann entropy, quantum decoherence, quantum entanglement, and quantum interference
- **Chronos Patterns**: Focuses on the temporal dimension of roulette outcomes, analyzing time-based patterns, dealer fatigue, session boundaries, and circadian rhythms
- **Neural Symphony**: Interprets roulette outcomes as musical patterns, analyzing rhythmic structures, harmonic relationships, musical scales, and melodic contours
- **Butterfly Effect**: Applies chaos theory to identify sensitive dependencies and bifurcation points in roulette outcomes
- **Golden Ratio**: Uses the golden ratio and Fibonacci sequences to find natural patterns and harmonics in roulette outcomes

## Setup

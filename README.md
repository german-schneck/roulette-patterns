## Strategy Methodologies

The system analyzes and compares multiple betting strategies:

- **Parity-Third Optimization**: Combines parity (odd/even) with third-section analysis for optimal coverage
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Applies the Fibonacci mathematical sequence to identify number patterns
- **Physical Wheel Section**: Focuses on specific physical sections of the roulette wheel
- **Best Original Group**: Selects the statistically best-performing group from baseline analysis
- **Variance Balance**: Optimizes spatial dispersion for maximum wheel coverage
- **Optimized Hybrid Combination**: Combines multiple strategies for a balanced approach
- **Temporal Cycles**: Detects cyclical patterns in historical results
- **Geometric Symmetry**: Exploits symmetric geometric patterns and potential wheel biases
- **Momentum-Based**: Analyzes momentum and trend patterns in recent spins
- **Hot Neighbors**: Sequential analysis of numbers following high performers
- **Dynamic Clustering**: Groups numbers based on statistical clustering algorithms
- **Advanced Neural Correlation**: Uses neural network techniques to find hidden correlations
- **Top Individual Numbers**: Selection of individual numbers with best hit-rate
- **Dealer Signature**: Analysis of croupier behavior patterns and tendencies
- **Mechanical Bias**: Detection of physical imperfections in the roulette wheel
- **Visual Ballistics**: Trajectory prediction based on initial conditions
- **Sector Targeting**: Strategic focus on high-probability wheel sections
- **Chaotic Domain**: Identification of strange attractors in chaotic systems
- **Latin Cancellation**: Pattern-based sequence analysis from Latin American casinos
- **Mexican Progression**: Modified Martingale system focusing on repeating clusters

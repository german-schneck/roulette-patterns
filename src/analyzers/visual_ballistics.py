    Analyze visual ballistics patterns to predict landing zones in the roulette wheel.
    
    Visual ballistics is a technique where players observe the initial conditions
    of the ball and wheel to predict approximate landing areas. This simulation
    models that technique by analyzing physical relationships between ball and wheel.
    
    Args:
        analyzer: The main roulette analyzer instance
        validation_analyzer: Analyzer used for validation

            - ballistic_win_rate: Win rate achieved with these numbers
